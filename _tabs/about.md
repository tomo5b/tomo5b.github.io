Hi, I’m Tom. I have a background in Mechanical Engineering, which I studied at Sheffield Hallam University. After graduating, I stayed in the city and completed a Doctorate at the University of Sheffield, where my research focused on developing ultrasound sensors to measure oil viscosity.

Since moving into industry, I’ve specialised in reliability engineering and data analysis. I'm currently completing an apprenticeship in machine learning to deepen my skills in this area.

This site is a mix of blog, portfolio, and project space — a place to share what I’m working on and learning.

I hope you enjoy having a look around.
